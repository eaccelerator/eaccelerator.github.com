It increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in their compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is almost completely eliminated. It also optimizes scripts to speed up their execution. eAccelerator typically reduces server load and increases the speed of your PHP code by 1-10 times.\r\n\r\neAccelerator stores compiled PHP scripts in shared memory and executes code directly from it. It creates locks only for a short time, while searching for a compiled PHP script in the cache, so one script can be executed simultaneously by several engines. Files that can't fit in shared memory are cached on disk only. \r\n\r\neAccelerator was born in December 2004 as a fork of the  Turck MMCache project. Turck MMCache was created by Dmitry Stogov and much of the eAccelerator code is still based on his work.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCurrrent contributor:\r\n* Hans Rakers (@hrak)\r\n\r\nFormer contributors to the project are:\r\n* Bart Vanbrabant (@bartv)\r\n* Franck Tabary\r\n* Everaldo Canuto (@ecanuto)\r\n* Reiner Jung\r\n* Shin Seung Woo\r\n* Frank Alcantara\r\n\r\nFor a full list see the wiki page at [link]\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nCheck out the documentation at http://github.com/eaccelerator/eaccelerator/wiki\r\nThe mailing list is available at http://groups.google.com/group/eaccelerator","name":"eAccelerator","tagline":"A PHP opcode cache / optimizer / accelerator"}
